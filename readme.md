NEURON mod files for the CaN and CaL currents from the papers:
Huang and Robinson Neurosci. 85:239 (1998) (exp.)
Benison et al., *J.Theor.Biol*. 210:187 (2001) (model).

- Running the kinetics.hoc simulation file will show 
the activation and inactivation steady-states, the time constants, 
and a family of curves generated modeling the same protocols 
used for Figs.2C-3A of the experimental paper.
The CaL conductance has been modeled as non-inactivating.

- The kinetic parameters used here are from the modeling paper.
They where chosen by the authors to fit the time course of the currents obtained from whole-cell 
data in their own laboratory, and are based on the results
presented in the experimental paper.

- The peak conductances have been adjusted to give approximately the
same peak currents shown in the experiments.
 
## Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
``` nrnivmodl ```
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
``` nrngui kinetics.hoc ```

## Under Windows using NEURON 5.1:
to compile the mod files use the ```mknrndll``` command.
A double click on the simulation file
kinetics.hoc
will open the simulation window.

Questions on the model parameters should be directed to the 
authors of the modeling paper.

Questions on how to use this model with NEURON
should be directed to michele.migliore@pa.ibf.cnr.it
